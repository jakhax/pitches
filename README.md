* Tested on Debian Linux
* Python 2.7

### Cloning the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakhax/pitches.git && cd pitches
```

### Creating a virtual environment

```bash
python2.7 -m virtualenv virtual-pitches
source virtual-pitches/bin/activate
```

python manage.py insert_initial_data
```

#### fake data for development 

using [Forgery_py](http://tomekwojcik.github.io/ForgeryPy/) library you can generate fake data and insert it to the database for testing 
the web app during development check out the example below for creating fake users
```python
def generate_fake_users(count=100):
    seed()
    for i in range(count):
        user_name = forgery_py.internet.user_name(True)[:32]
        u = User(email=forgery_py.internet.email_address(),
                 username=user_name,
                 username_normalized=user_name.lower(),
                 password=forgery_py.lorem_ipsum.word(),
                 confirmed=True,
                 name=forgery_py.name.full_name()[:64],
                 homeland=forgery_py.address.city()[:64],
                 about=forgery_py.lorem_ipsum.sentence(),
                 created_at=forgery_py.date.date(True))
        db.session.add(u)
        try:
            db.session.commit()
        except IntegrityError:
            db.session.rollback()
```
### Running Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Running the server 
#### Development mode
The following are enabled in development mode 
```python 
class DevConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = True
    TESTING = True

```

Run server
```bash 
# starting server by defaut will run it in development mode
python manage.py server
```
#### production mode
```python
class ProdConfig(Config):
    DEBUG = False
    TESTING = False
    DEBUG_TB_INTERCEPT_REDIRECTS = False
```

make the following change to the config.py script
'''python
config=ProdConfig()
'''
